 	Brihat Jataka
Brihat Jataka is a great classic of Vedic astrology composed by The Great Varahamihira, who was the famous astrologer in the court of The Great king Vikramaditya in the year 57BC. He was also a great astronomer and the first one to mention in his work Pancha Siddhantika, based on our ancient Siddhantas, that the ayanamsa, or the shifting of the equinox is 50.32 seconds. He also authored the famous Brihat Samhita, Laghu Jataka and Yogayatra. His other famous classic is Daivagya Vallabha, which deals with prashna or horary astrology.

Chapter 1 Explanation of technicalities used 
Stanza 1: 
The Sun, who is one of the AshtaMurthies of Siva, who forms the path for those who go to Moksha, who represents Atma for those who are well versed in Atmavidya, who accepts the results of the sacrificial rites, who is the master of Amaras and Jyotishas; who destroys, creates and protects the Lokas, who is praised in the Vedas in various forms, who is possessed of many rays and who is the lamp of the three worlds, may he grant us speech. 
Stanza 2: 
Although there are great many works ably written by intelligent men in accordance with excellent literary style, many people get dispirited in trying to cross the vast ocean of horoscopic knowledge; to such I offer a small boat, constructed with metre of various kinds, short but very suggestive and full of instructive ideas, to enable them to cross this ocean. 
Stanza 3: 
The science of astrology is called Hora Sastra from the compounding of the two words Aho and Ratri and the dropping of the first and last letters; and it speaks of the results of the good and bad deeds done by men in their previous births. 
Stanza 4: 
In the celestial Chakra (globe) the signs commencing with Mesha and Aswini, are each formed by nine padams (quarters) of stars and govern the following organs of Kalapurusha, namely, head, face, chest, heart, belly, waist, lower belly, sexual organ, thighs, knees, buttocks and feet respectively. Rasi, Kshetra, Griha, Ruksha, Bha and Bhavana refer to and signify the zodiacal signs. 
Stanza 5: 
Meena is represented by two fishes lying close to each other with their heads pointing in opposite directions; Kumbha is shown by a person bearing a water pot; Mithuna is indicated by a man with a club and a woman with a lute, in close embrace; Dhanus is described as a Centaur with the hind part resembling that of a horse and the front of an archer; Makara bears the representation of the face of a deer with the hinder part of a crocodile; Thula represents the appearance of a man with a balance in hand; Kanya is shown by a virgin seated in a boat with a crop in one hand and with a light in the other, and the other signs are represented by their names and move in places congenial to their nature. 
Stanza 6: 
Kuja, Sukra, Budha, Chandra, Ravi, Budha, Sukra, Kuja, Guru, Sani, Sani and Guru are respectively the lords of the signs and their divisions from Mesha; the navamsas commence from Mesha, Makara, Thula and Kataka, etc., Dwadasamsas commence from the houses themselves.

Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury and Venus govern five, eight, seven and five Bhagas (degrees) respectively in the Trimsamsas of the odd signs while the order is reversed in those of the even signs.

Stanza 11: 
The signs are cruel and beneficial regularly, they are also masculine and feminine, the same are also movable, fixed and common; the lords of the cardinal points are the lords of the triangular houses from Mesha, Vrishabha, Mithuna and Kataka. In odd signs, the first hora is governed by Ravi and the second hora by Chandra and the reverse holds good in the even signs. The lords of the Drekkanas are the lords of the 1st, 5th and 9th in a rasi. 
Stanza 12: 
Some writers on astrology say that the first hora is governed by the lord of that house while the second hora is governed by the lord of the eleventh from that house. They further say that the lords of the Drekkanas are: (1) the lord of the first, (2) the lord of the 12th, and (3) the lord of the eleventh houses respectively. 
Stanza 13: 
Aries, Taurus, Capricorn, Virgo, Cancer, Pisces and Libra are signs of exaltation for the Sun, etc., respectively.

Stanza 17: 
Kantaka, Kendra and Chatustaya denote quadrants and these are Saptama (7th), Lagna (1st), Chaturtha (4th) and Kha (10th) Bhanam Rasis (signs). The Nara Rasis (masculine signs) are Mithuna, Kanya, Thula, the first half of Dhanus and Kumbha and these are powerful when they happen to be birth signs.

All signs in kendras are powerful. Signs in Panaparas are of moderate strength while signs in Apoklimas are powerless. Biped signs are powerful during day, Quadruped signs in the night and Kita Rasi during the two twilights. The measure of the rasis from Mesha to Kanya inclusive is 5-6-7-8-9 and 10 multiplied by four, respectively, the other half from Thula to Meena in the reverse order, Sahaja (3rd) is called Duschikya, Navama (9th) is denoted as Thapas and Trikona.

Chapter 3 Viyoni Janmadhyaya 
Stanza 1: 
When benefics are powerless and malefics powerful, and when impotent planets are in quadrants, the birth must be foretold of objects that have resemblance to the nature of the dwadasamsa occupied by Moon at the time, or when under similar conjunctions the birth sign is aspected by impotent planets, the birth of viyonis must be predicted 
Stanza 2:

Stanza 5: 
If birth is in pakshi drekkana, if Saturn joins or aspects it, the birth of birds must be predicted. If Moon is there or aspects it, predict the birth of water-birds. If the navamsa falls in Mercurial signs with Saturn in conjunction or aspecting, then ordinary birds, but if Moon joins or aspects it, aquatic birds must be predicted 
Stanza 6: 
When the birth sign, Moon, Jupiter and Sun are powerless, the birth of trees must be predicted. The nature of the plants (aquatic or land) must be identified by the rising navamsa, and the number of the trees by the number of the navaaamsas that the lord of the navamsa has passed from his rising amsa in the lagna 
Stanza 7:

Chapter 4 Nishika (consummation of marriage) 
Stanza 1: 
Mars and the Moon are the cause for monthly menses. When the Moon is in anupachaya rasis the menses for conception occurs. When the reverse is the case, and the masculine benefics aspect, the woman gets sexual union with man. 
Stanza 2: 
The sexual union resembles the nature of the Astha rasi. If malefics conjoin or aspect the 7th, union will be consummated under quarrelling, if benefics join or aspect the 7th, the sexual union will be happy. 
Stanza 3: 
If Ravi, Chandra, Sukra and Kuja occupy their own navamsas, if Guru is found in lagna or thrikona, conception takes place. If this combination is present in impotent cases, it will be useless as moonlight is to a blind man. 
Stanza 4: 
If Kuja and Arkaja occupy the seventh from Ravi and Chandra, they make the man and the woman sick respectively. If they occupy the 12th and the 2nd from Ravi and Chandra, the man and woman will meet with Mrityu respectively. If Kuja and Arkaja join Ravi and Chandra, and has one of their aspects.

Stanza 6: 
If malefics are approaching the rising sign without beneficial aspects the woman dies. If Saturn occupies the rising sign aspected by Mars or weak Moon she dies. 
Stanza 7: 
If the rising sign and the Moon are betwixt two evil planets unaspected by benefics jointly or separately the woman dies in pregnancy 
Stanza 8: 
If from the rising sign of the Moon the 4th house is joined by evil planets and Mars is in the 8thhouse, she suffers death. If from lagna, the 4th and 12th houses are occupied by the Sun and Mars and the Moon is weak, she suffers death as before. 
Stanza 9: 
If Kuja and Ravi are in the 1st and 7th respectively, death occurs to her by weapons. The abortion takes place in the month, whose lord is powerless or afflicted. 
Stanza 10: 
If benefics are in conjunction with lagna and Chandra, of if the 5th, 9th, 2nd, 7th, 4th and 10th houses from them are occupied be benefics or if the malefics occupy 3rd and 11th houses, and aspected by the Sun she will have a safe and happy pregnancy. 
Stanza 11: 
If powerful lagna, Ravi, Chandra and Guru occupy odd signs or navamsas, they cause masculine birth. If these occupy even signs and amsas, they produce feminine birth. If Guru and Ravi are found in odd signs, then a male, if Sukra, Kuja and Chandra are in even signs, a female is born. If these planets are in double-bodied signs aspected by Budha, there will be twins after the sex of the zodiacal sign. 
Stanza 12: 
If Saturn occupies odd signs from the lagna (excepting lagna), he causes male birth. Examine the relative strength of the various planets and predict the birth of males or females. 
Stanza 13: 
If the Moon and the Sun aspect mutually, if Saturn and Mercury aspect mutually; if Mars, in an odd sign, aspects the Sun in an even sign; if the Moon and lagna are in odd, and have the aspect of Mars in even sign; if the Moon is in even and Mercury in odd, and have the aspect of Mars; if Venus, lagna and the Moon are posited in masculine amsas; in all these six cases, eunuchs will be born. 
Stanza 14: 
If the Moon and Venus are in signs, and if Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and lagna are in odd signs, twins are born, of whom one will be male and the other female. Lagna and the Moon in even houses aspected by male planets, produce twins, as above. If powerful Budha, Kuja, Guru and lagna are in even signs, then predict the same result. If planets and lagna are in common amsas, aspected by Mercury in his amsa, three children will be born, of whom two will partake of the sex of the amsa occupied by Mercury and the other of the opposite sex. If planets, lagna and Budha are in similar amsas, then three children of that sex will be born. 
Stanza 15: 
If lagna is in Dhanus, or falls in that amsa, if all the planets are powerful Sani and Budha, then predict many children at one birth. 
Stanza 16: 
Kalala, Ghana, Ankura, Asthi, Charma, Angaja, Chetamatha are governed by Sukra, Kuja, Guru, Ravi, Chandra, Sani and Budha respectively. The lord of lagna, Chandra, and Ravi are rulers of the next three months respectively. The foetal growth depends upon the strength and weakness of the planets, who govern the particular month. 
Stanza 17: 
If Budha is in thrikona, and other planets are powerless, then the child will have two faces, four hands, and four legs with one face. If the Moon is in Taurus, and evil planets are in Ruksha Sandhis, predict a dumb child. If, in this conjunction, the Moon has beneficial aspect, the child begins to speak very late in life. 
Stanza 18: 
If Sani and Kuja occupy Budha’s houses or navamsas, the child will be born with teeth. If Kataka is lagna with Chandra init, having the aspects of Sani and Kuja, the child will be dwarf. If Meena becomes lagna becomes a cripple. If the Rasi Sandhis are occupied by malefics and the Moon, the child will be deaf. In all these cases there must be no beneficial aspects. Stanza 19: 
If the last navamsa of Makara is lagna aspected by Sani, Chandra and Ravi then a dwarf is born. If malefics occupy the 5th, 9th and 1st drekkanas, handless, feetless and headless child respectively must be predicted. 
Stanza 20: 
If Leo is birth occupied by the Sun and the Moon, aspected by Mars and Saturn the child will be blind. If in the above combination there is also beneficial aspect the vision will be dim. The Moon in the 12th house causes loss to the left eye and the Sun there causes loss to the right eye. Beneficial aspects give some relief in these combinations. 
Stanza 21: 
The birth of a child takes place in the sign occupied by the Moon, which is represented by the number, in which Dwadasamsa, the Moon is fixed at the time. The day or the night and the ghaties of the birth time must be known by the number of the ghaties at the time of the question and the nature of the sign whether diurnal or nocturnal. 
Stanza 22: 
If Makara or Kumbha navamsa rises at the time of conception, aspected by Sani, the child will be born after 4 years. If Katakamsa rises at the time of conception, aspected by Chandra, then the birth occurs after 12 years of pregnancy. The details in this chapter must be carefully understood and applied with sense and judgment. 
Chapter 5 Janma Kala lakshana 
Stanza 1: 
If birth sign is unaspected by the Moon, father will be absent at the birth. If the Sun occupies a movable sign (pathitha) from the 10th, the father will be away in a foreign country at the birth of child. 
Stanza 2: 
If Saturn occupies lagna or if Mars is in the 7th or if the Moon is between Mercury and Venus, the father will be absent at the birth of the child. 
Stanza 3: 
If the Moon occupies Mars drekkana and benefics are in the 2nd and 11th houses, predict a serpent’s birth. If an evil sign falls in Kuja’s drekkana and has benefics in the 2nd and the 11th, the child will be bound by a serpent-like bandage. Stanza 4: 
If the Sun occupies a quadruped sign and if other powerful planets occupy common signs, twins will be born covered with a common hood. 
Stanza 5: 
If Mesha, Simha or Vrishabha falls as lagna, occupies by Sani or Kuja, the child will be born with a cowl or cord in that organ which is represented by the rising navamsa. 
Stanza 6: 
If Jupiter does not aspect birth and Moon, or if he does not aspect the Sun, in conjunction with the Moon, if the Moon with a malefic combines with the Sun then say certainly the child is born to another person or of adultery. 
Stanza 7: 
If malefics occupy the signs of cruel planets and are in the 7th, 9th or 5th from the Sun, the father will be imprisoned when the child is born. The sign occupied by the Sun determines the locality of his bondage. 
Stanza 8: 
If Full Moon is in cancer, if Mercury is in lagna and benefics are in the 4th, the delivery takes place in a boat or steamer, or in a sea voyage. If birth is watery with the Moon in the 7th the same result happens. 
Stanza 9: 
If birth falls in a watery sign as also the Moon, the delivery will be close to water. If lagna (a watery sign) has Full Moon’s aspect the same result happens. If, for such lagna, the Moon is there or in the 5th or 10th then similar results happen. 
Stanza 10: 
If Saturn occupies the 12th, and a malefic aspects the Moon, the woman delivers the child when in bondage or jail. If Saturn is in Scorpio or Cancer one of which is the birth aspected by the Moon, the delivery takes place in a hole or hollow or pit. 
Stanza 11: 
If birth is watery with Saturn in it, aspected by Mercury, the Sun and the Moon, the birth takes place in playgrounds, temples and uncultivated fields, respectively. 
Stanza 12: 
If birth with Sani falls in a Nara Rasi aspected by Kuja the birth happens in a grave-yard; aspected by Sukra and Chandra in pleasant places; aspected by Guru in sacrificial places; aspected by Ravi in royal mansions, cowsheds, or temple premises; aspected by Budha in libraries, art colleges or carpenters’ premises. 
Stanza 13: 
Place of birth happens to be according to the nature of the rasi and navamsa, either at home or outside. The birth place should be determined according to the strength of the lagna either in rasi or navamsa. 
Stanza 14: 
If the Moon or the Sun is in the 9th or 5th from Saturn and Mars, the child will be forsaken by its mother. If in that combination Jupiter aspects it, the child lives long and prospers although forsaken by its mother. 
Stanza 15: 
If the Moon is in birth aspected by a malefic and has Mars in the 7th the forsaken babe will perish. If in this combination Mars and Saturn are in the 11th, the child dies, if aspected by a benefic, the child gets protection by such caste man as is indicated by the benefic; if aspected by malefics, the child falls to different hands and dies. 
Stanza 16: 
The birth takes place in the house of the father or mother according to the strength of their lords. If benefics occupy debilitated places, birth will be under trees, roads, etc. If benefics occupy neecha and if the Moon and birth are unaspected by other planets occupying one house, the birth occurs in lonely places. 
Stanza 17: 
If Moon joins Saturn’s amsa or is in the 4th or has aspect of Saturn or occupies watery signs or conjoins with Saturn, then birth takes place in darkness. If there are three or more debilitated planets, birth takes place on the ground. The birth takes place similar to the rasi which rises on a level with the equator. If malefics occupy the 4th or 7th from Moon or join Moon, the delivery is attended with much pain. 
Stanza 18: 
The quantity of oil by Moon, the wick by the birth sign and the light by Sun, the door by the planets in quadrants or by the most powerful of the planets must be ascertained. 
Stanza 19: 
If Saturn is the strongest, the house will be one newly repaired having become old; if Mars is so, it’s partly burnt; if Moon, new; if the Sun, the house contains much wood; and if Mercury, built by many artists; if Venus, handsome, painted and new; if Jupiter, strong house; the adjoining houses must be indicated similarly by the planets in the rasis. 
Stanza 20: 
If birth falls in Mesha, Kataka, Thula, Vrischika and Kumbha, or in these navamsa the delivery will be in the eastern part of the house. If the birth falls in Guru’s or Budha’s houses or amsas the delivery happens in the northern part of the house. If it falls in Vrishabha or its amsa the birth takes place in the west and if it falls in Makara or Simha or their navamsas the birth place will be in the southern side. Stanza 21: 
The cardinal direction of the lying down must be indicated by two signs from Mesha etc., and the corners by the double-bodied signs. Similarly I must be ascertained for the direction of the bed, etc. The legs of the cost or the sides of the bed must be ascertained by the 6th, 3rd, 9th and 12th houses from lagna. 
Stanza 22: 
The number of women to assist the delivery must be determined by the number of planets between the Moon and the lagna. Their presence inside or outside the delivery room has to be learnt by the planets in the invisible and the visible half of the zodiac respectively. Some say quite the reverse. 
Stanza 23: 
The body of the child will resemble the planet who is the lord of the navamsa or who is the most powerful. The color of the infant will resemble that of the lord of the navamsa occupied by the Moon. Taking the lagna as head, etc., the limbs resemble the rasis in which they fall. 
Stanza 24: 
If the first drekkana rises in the lagna; by the Drusya and Adrusya halves of the zodiac, left and right sides of head, eyes, ears, nose, temples, cheeks and face must be determined from the lagna respectively. If the second drekkana rises in the lagna, neck, shoulders, arms, sides, chest, belly and navel should be similarly determined. If the third drekkana rises in the lagna, lower stomach, sexual organ and anus, testicles, thighs, knees, calves and feet must be similarly delineated. 
Stanza 25: 
If those rasis are occupied by the malefics there will be sores or wounds, if these are occupied or aspected by benefics there will be marks; if such planets causing sores, etc.-are in their won rasis or navamsas or infixed signs or navamsas, the sores, etc., will accompany birth, if not they come by accidents after birth. If such a planet is Saturn the wounds will be caused by stones and windy diseases; if Mars by fire, weapons and poisons; if Mercury by the earth or the ground; if the Sun by wood or quadrupeds; if the Moon by horned animals or aquatics; if they are other planets then there will be no wounds. 
Stanza 26: 
If Mercury joins three other planets in any rasi he will cause wounds in that organ which is governed by it. If an evil planet is in the 6th from birth, there will be wound in that organ represented by that rasi. If such a malefic has beneficial aspect then there will be Thilaka, Masaka, etc., there. If benefics join him there will be Lakshma, etc. 
Chapter 6 Balarishta (early death) 
Stanza 1: 
Children born during sandhi or when birth is in Chandra hora, when evil planets occupy the ends of signs or when four malefics (including Moon) occupy quadrants, will die 
Stanza 2: 
If cruel and benefic planets occupy the first and the second halves of the zodiac respectively and the birth rises in an insect rasi or if the birth and the 7th ar placed between malefics, the child dies straightaway 
Stanza 3: 
If malefics occupy birth and 7th and if Moon joins cruel planets, unaspected by benefics, the child dies quickly 
Stanza 4: 
If a weak Moon occupies the 12th with malefics in the birth and the 8th without benefics in quadrants, the child dies soon 
Stanza 5: 
If Moon joins a malefic and occupies the 7th, 8th or 12th and when benefics aren’t in quadrants and don’t aspect these, the child dies Stanza 6: 
If Moon occupies 6th or 8th aspected by malefics, early death comes. If such Moon has beneficial aspects, the child dies before 8. If such Moon ahs mixed aspets, the child lives for 4 years. If a benefic occupies the 6th or 8th aspected by powerful malefics, the child lives for a month. If the lord of the birth joins the 7th and suffers defeat there by malefics, similar results must be predicted 
Stanza 7: 
If a weak Moon joins the lagna with malefics in the 8th or quadrants, or if Moon is betwixt malefics occupying the 4th, 7th or 8th, the child dies. If Moon is in lagna as above stated, malefics in the 7th and 8th without the aspect of powerful benefics, the mother and child both die 
Stanza 8: 
If Moon occupies the last navamsa of the sign and malefics are in the 5th and 9th without beneficial aspects, or if lagna joins Moon with malefics in the 7th, the child dies immediately 
Stanza 9: 
If Moon joins a malefic in lagna, eclipsed with Mars in the 8th, both mother and child die. Similarly, if Sun is in lagna, death results from weapons. If Moon or Sun occupy the lagna with powerful malefics in trines and the 8th, unassociated with benefics, the child dies 
Stanza 10: 
If Saturn, Sun, Moon and Mars occupy the 12th, 9th, lagna and 8th respectively, unaspected by a powerful Jupiter, the child dies quickly 
Stanza 11: 
If Moon is with malefics and occupies a trine, 7th, 8th or 12th and not aspected by or combined with a powerful Venus, Mercury or Jupiter, death comes early 
Stanza 12: 
If Moon in transit joins the house of the most powerful malefic in the above yogas or joins his own place, or the lagna, when he’s strong and has strong malefic aspects, he causes death to the child within one year Chapter 7 
Ayurdaya (Longevity) Stanza 1: 
Sun, in deep exaltation give 19, Moon 25, Mars 15, Mercury 12, Jupiter 15, Venus 21 and Saturn 20 years of life respectively according to Maya, Yavana, Manitha and Saktipurva. 
Stanza 2: 
Where a planet is debilitated he cuts away half of the term of life and in the middle rasis he give terms of life as per rule of three. The lagna is supposed to give that number of years, which is represented by its amsa, while others say the number will be similar to the rasi. A planet in an unfriendly sign cuts one-third of his term unless he is retrograde. The combust planets except Venus and Saturn, cut off half their term of life. 
Stanza 3: 
Evil planets in the 12th, 11th, 10th, 9th, 8th, and 7th away 1, ½, 1/3, ¼, 1/6 and 1/8th of the term of life allotted to them respectively. If benefics occupy the same houses, they take away only one half of that which the malefics do. Satyacharya says that, if there are many planets in anyone of the houses, only the most powerful among them will eat the proportion of life granted by it. 
Stanza 4: 
If an evil planet occupies the birth the number of amsas, etc., passed by the lagna must be multiplied by the total of the planetary terms of years, etc., and then divided by 108, and deducted from the total term of life the figure thus obtained. If a benefic aspects the above conjunction, half of this must be deducted. 
Stanza 5: 
Men and elephants have 60 x 2 years as terms of life and 5 days more. Horses live 32 years. Camels and asses 25 years. Buffaloes and bullocks live 24 years. Dogs have 12 years. Goats etc., 16 years. 
Stanza 6: 
If the last navamsa of Meena becomes lagna. If Mercury is in the 25th minute in Vrishabha and if all the rest are in their deep exaltations, the person gets the utmost limit of life, viz., 120 years and 5 days. 
Stanza 7 & 8 
Vishnugupta, Devaswami and Siddhasena have given similar longevity. There is one serious objection to the acceptance of their theory, because according to them, no children can die above 8 and below 20 years which is absurd. 
They have further stated that those who have this longevity will also become emperors. This is erroneous as many men live long and still be beggars 
Stanza 9: 
Jeevasarma says, on his own responsibility, that each of the planets gives one-seventh of the period of the longevity stated above. Satyacharya says that each planet gives that term of life which is indicated by the navamsa he occupies. This seems to be approved of by many astrological experts. 
Stanza 10: 
Convert the intended planet’s position into kalas; divide this by 200; the quotient, if divisable, divided by 12 represents years, etc. 
Stanza 11: 
A planet in exaltation or retrogression will give 3 times the term of his life. If he is in Vargottama or in his own house or navamsa or drekkana he gives double the period. This is the speciality named by Satyacharya. 
Stanza 12: 
Lagna gives similar number of years as it has advance in the navamsa. If it is very powerful it will give similar to the rasi. If a malefic is in lagna no deduction should be made on this account. Do not take the terms of life granted by the planets as stated before. 
Stanza 13: 
Satyacharya’s system is excellent, but many have spoiled it by useless multiplication. Whenever two or three figures are to be multiplied, then multiply it by that figure which are presents the strongest factors. 
Stanza 14: 
If birth falls in Kataka and Guru and Chandra are in it, Budha and Sukra in the kendras, the rest in 3-6-11 the person lives very long and mathematical calculations for longevity do not apply to such a combination.

Chapter 8 Dasantardasa 
Stanza 1: 
The most powerful among Lagna, Surya and Chandra, with planets in their kendras give results in the commencement, middle, and last periods of life respectively. If planets are not in kendras, etc., the results will flow in the commencement even from Apoklima planets. 
Stanza 2: 
The planet most powerful gives the first dasa extending over that period of life granted by him. If many planets are equally powerful then the first dasa will belong to that planet who gives the largest term of life. If some planets give equal terms of life, then the first dasa will be given by that planet who rises first. 
Stanza 3: 
The planet with the Dasanatha gives half the term of that dasa with his results. The planet who occupies the thrikona from him gives one-third of that period with his results. The planet in the 7th from him gives one-seventh of his period. The planet who is in chaturasra gives one-fourth of that term. In this manner lagna and planets give their Dasas and Antardasas. 
Stanza 4: 
Bring all the fractions to a common figure, omit the denominators and multiply severally the numerators by the dasa years and then divide the whole by the total of the numerators. By doing this you get the Antardasa periods. 
Stanza 5: 
The Dasa (period) of a most powerful and exalted planet is called the Poorna Dasa. The dasa of a powerless planet is called the Rikta. The period of that planet which is in the navamsa of unfriendly amsa is called the Aristaphala. 
Stanza 6: 
The planet who has fallen from exaltation gives Avarohi Dasa. If he joins friendly or exalted navamsa, he constitutes Madhya Dasa. 
The planet who is ascending from his debilitation gives Arohani Dasa. If such a planet occupies debilitated or unfriendly navamsa, he gives a worthless period. 
Stanza 7: 
If a planet is in a good house and joins debilitated or unfriendly navamsa, it gives mixed results. The names are fixed for these indicative of their results. I shall give the results of the periods of the Sun, etc., later on. 
Stanza 8: 
If lagna rises in common sign, its drekkanas constitute Adhama, Madhya and Pujita respectively. If lagna is movable, the order must be reversed. If lagna is fixed, they constitute Ashubha, Ista and Sama respectively. Lagna Dasas are thus arranged. 
Stanza 9: 
Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, the Sun and Saturn give 1, 2, 9, 20, 18, 20, 50 years respectively of Nisargika Dasa. If in the previously stated dasa period of the planets, they get also this ?Nisargika dasa, they produce good results. Some of Yavanaas say that the Lagna Dasa comes in the end and gives good. Some do not accept this view. 
Stanza 10: 
If the anthardasanatha is in lagna, or if his friend is in lagna, or if lagna falls in his friend’s or in his varga, the dasa beginning then, will be productive of good. Or if he is in the 3rd, 6th, 10th or 11th houses it is good. Or if the Moon occupies the exaltation house of the Pakaswami or his friendly rasi, or thrikona, or the 7th from him, it produces good. If it is the reverse it produces bad. Stanza 11: 
That dasa which begins when the Moon is in his own house is good and gives honour, wealth and happiness. That dasa which begins when the Moon is in Kuja’s house makes his wife immoral; if that dasa begins when the Moon is in Budha’s house it gives education, friends and wealth; if the dasa begins when the Moon is in Simha it gives work for him in forts, forests, roads, houses and agriculture; if it begins when the Moon is in Sukra’s house he gives all desirable food; if it begins when the Moon is in Sani’s house it gives mean woman; if it begins when the Moon is in Guru’s house it gives reputation, wealth and happiness. 
Stanza 12: 
The Sun gives wealth by Nakha, (nails or claws) teeth, skins, gold, cruelty, travel, kings and wars. He makes the man hot-tempered determined in doing work, in getting reputation and good by courage. He gets misery through wife, children, wealth, enemy, weapon, fire and king. The Sun gives liberty, fondness for sinful deeds, quarrels among his workmen or servants, complaints in chest, stomach and other diseases. 
Stanza 13: 
During the Moon’s period the person gets money or profits from mantras, Brahmins, sugarcane, milk, clothes, flowers, playing, oil seeds, good and fatigue or pain. He will be fond of sleep, laziness, enduring pain, Brahmins and Devatas, getting female issues, possessed of good intelligence, reputation, earning and spending, and he will pick quarrels with is own men and those who are more powerful than himself. 
Stanza 14: 
During the period of Mars there will be destruction of enemies, gains from rulers, lands, brothers, sheep and wool. He will have hatred among his children, wife, friends, brothers, learned men, and preceptors. He will suffer from thirst, bloody diseases, fever, bile, fractures. He’ll be fond of others’ wives, sinful men and uncharitable deeds. He’ll be harsh, hot and evil-tempered 
Stanza 15: 
In the period of Mercury, the person gets wealth by embassy, friends, preceptors and Brahmins. He’ll be praised by learned men and thereby gets reputation. He gets gold, mules, lands and personal charm, and happiness. He’ll be witty and humorous and will be clever in serving. he’ll have a good mind and charitable disposition. Harshness, fatigue, restraint or imprisonment, mental disease and complaints from the three dhatus (vaata, pittha and sleshma) will result 
Stanza 16: 
In his period, Jupiter gives honor, good character, good mind, personal charm, courage, philanthropic disposition, determination and devotion. He gets wealth thru mantras, kings, vedic recitation, counsel and skill in diplomacy. He’ll have gold, houses, sons, elephants, clothes and friendship with good rulers. he gets troubled by deep thinking, diseases in the ear and hatred among lawless people 
Stanza 17: 
During Venus’ period, the person will be fond of music, pleasure, fine scents, good food and drink, clothes, females, gems, personal charm, sensual pleasure, yogis, friends, desirable personages, skill in merchandise, agriculture, treasure-troves, wealth, hated by communities, kings, wild people, vagabonds and sorrow thru friendship 
Stanza 18: 
During Saturn’s period, the person gets donkeys, camels, birds, buffaloes, old women, leadership over communities, towns or cities, and inferior gains. he gets miseries or troubles thru phlegm, jealousy, wind, anger, derangement, dirt, laziness and fatigue. He’ll be insulted and terrified by servants, children, wife and will suffer the loss of a limb Stanza 19: 
Good periods give happiness and bad periods produce misery. Mixed periods give mixed results and the result of the lagna dasa will be similar in nature to its lord 
Stanza 20: 
In the period of each planet, the results will be based on the materials or objects that have been detailed in the Saumgnyadhyaya and the means of livelihood detailed in the Karma Jivadhyaya. Results of the planets will be determined by the aspects, occupation and other combinations given elsewhere 
Stanza 21: 
Different planets give their luster of the mahabootas in their periods. This luster or shade has to be identified by the nose, face, eyes, skin and ear obtained by or thru the earth, water, fire, air and space 
Stanza 22: 
During the time of an auspicious planet, the mind of the person will be good. It enables the man to get wealth and secure happiness. The dasa may also be known by the happiness or misery the man is subjected to. The results produced by powerless planets will be enjoyed in dreams and thoughts 
Stanza 23: 
If one planet represents two contrary results, the effect will be the destruction of those events. but if one is stronger than the other, the stronger prevails. If one planet represents one and another indicates a contrary result, there’ll be both the results. Planets give good or bad in their own periods

The places mentioned above are good and the rest evil. The good or bad results will be ascertained by the ciphers and figures marked as stated above and the balances show good. Planets in upachaya, in friendly or own houses and exaltations give plenty of good; planets in apachayas, in debilitation or unfriendly houses don’t do good Chapter 10 Karmajeeva (profession) 
Stanza 1: 
From Sun, etc., the acquisition of wealth must be predicted thru father, mother, enemy, friend, brother, woman and servant respectively, when he occupies the 10th house from birth or Moon, or thru lord of the navamsa occupied by the lord of the 10th, from birth, Moon or Sun

Chapter 11 Rajayoga 
Stanza 1: 
Yavanas say that three or more cruel planets in exaltation will produce a cruel-minded king. Jeevasarma and his school say that exalted cruel planets won’t raise a man to kingly power Stanza 2: 
If Mars, Saturn, Sun and Jupiter or any three of them are exalted and one of these three occupies the lagna, 16 rajayogas arise. If Moon is in his own house, and any two of the above planets are in exaltation, with one of them in birth, or if any of the above-named planets is in exaltation occupying the lagna, they produce 16 rajayogas 
Stanza 3: 
If lagna or Moon occupies vargottama and has the aspects of four or more planets, except Moon, 22 rajayogas are generated 
Stanza 4: 
If Saturn is in Aquarius, Sun in Aries, Moon in Taurus and lagna rises in one of these, and Mercury, Jupiter and Mars are in Gemini, Leo and Scorpio, there’ll be combinations for royalty. If Sun and Moon are in exaltation and lagna rises in one of these signs and if Sun and Mercury are in the 6th, and if Venus, Mars and Jupiter are in Libra, Aries and Cancer, they generate two rajayogas 
Stanza 5: 
If Mars is in Capricorn, Sun and Moon in Sagittarius, and lagna rising in Capricorn with Saturn in it, the person becomes a king. If, in the above combination, Moon joins Mars in birth or if Saturn and Moon are in 7th, if Jupiter is in Sagittarius, and Aries becomes lagna with Sun there, the person becomes a king 
Stanza 6: 
If Taurus rises at birth with Moon in it, and Sun, Jupiter and Saturn are in the 4th, 7th and 10th respectively, the person certainly becomes a king. If Capricorn is birth with Saturn in it, and 3, 6, 9 or 12 are occupied by Moon, etc., the person becomes a famous, good-natured and prominent king 
Stanza 7: 
If Jupiter with Moon is in Sagittarius, Mars in Capricorn and Pisces or Virgo is the lagna with Mercury and Venus there, two rajayogas arise. If Mars and Saturn occupy the 5th, Jupiter, Moon and Venus join the 4th, if Virgo rises as lagna with Mercury in it, the person becomes a king with good character 
Stanza 8: 
If Pisces becomes lagna with Moon in it, Saturn, Mars and Sun are in Aquarius, Capricorn and Leo respectively, the person born will rule the earth. 
If Aries becomes lagna with Mars in it, with Jupiter in Cancer or if Cancer rises with Jupiter in it, with Mars in Aries, a king will be born 
Stanza 9: 
If Cancer is lagna with Jupiter in it and if Moon, Venus and Mercury are in Taurus and Sun in Aries, a mighty king will be born

Stanza 11: 
If an exalted Mercury is in lagna, Venus in Gemini, Moon and Jupiter in Pisces with Saturn and Mars in Capricorn, the person becomes a king 
Stanza 12: 
In the combinations for royalty sketched before, persons born in poverty will become kings; much more so persons born in royal families. The combinations to be given hereafter will make men kings who are born in royal families and others born in ordinary families will become equal to kings 
Stanza 13: 
If there are three or more powerful exalted or moolatrikona planets in a horoscope, a person born in a royal family will become a king. If this number is five or more, then persons born in ordinary families will become rulers. If these planets are powerless, the persons won’t be kings but wealthy men 
Stanza 14: 
If Aries is the lagna with Sun half-rising and Moon in it, Mars in Capricorn and Jupiter in Sagittarius, the person born in a royal family becomes a king 
Stanza 15: 
When Venus occupies the 4th from lagna, Moon occupies the 9th and the rest are in the 1st, 3rd and 11th houses, the person becomes a king 
Stanza 16: 
If a powerful Mercury is in lagna, a powerful benefic in the 9th and the rest of the planets in the 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 10th or 11th, the person born in a royal family will become a good and charitable king 
Stanza 17: 
If Taurus is lagna and Moon, Jupiter and Saturn and other planets occupy the 1st, 2nd, 6th and 11th respectively, or if Moon and Sun in the 10th and Saturn in lagna and other planets in the 11th, the person becomes king 
Stanza 18: 
If Moon, Saturn and Jupiter are in the 10th, 11th and 1st respectively, Mercury and Mars in the 2nd and Venus and Sun in the 4th, the person becomes a king. If Mars and Sun are in lagna, Moon, Jupiter, Venus, Sun and Mercury are in the 4th, 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th respectively, the person becomes a king 
Stanza 19: 
The person gets royal power in the antaradasa of the most powerful planet or of the planet who combines in the 10th or the 1st. He loses that power in the antaradasa of the planet who’s unfriendly or debilitation house because such a period is called the chara dasa. He then must seek protection from a powerful king Stanza 20: 
If Jupiter, Venus or Mercury is in lagna, Saturn in 7th and Sun in the 10th, the person will enjoy his life well. If beneficial signs are powerful and fall in quadrants and malefics occupy cruel signs, the person will be a master of hunters, thieves and wealth

By combinations of two, three and four the multiples of 9, 10, 8 by 3, 3 and 4 respectively will be the number of Nabhasa yogas obtained by this process. Yavanas have described 1800 varieties but I will describe them here briefly. 
Stanza 2: 
If the planets are in Chara, etc., Rajju, Musala and Nala yogas are formed respectively according to Satya. These are Asraya yogas. Parasara mentions two yogas as Dala under sruk and sarpa when the benefics and malefics are in kendras respectively. 
Stanza 3: 
Asraya yogas, according to some, are really incorporated in the Yava, Abja, Vajra, Andaja, Golaka, etc., to be stated hereafter. Dala yogas have no separate significance, according to some, as the results of benefics and malefics occupying the kendras have already been indicated. 
Stanza 4: 
When two adjacent quadrants are combined with all the planets it goes under the name of Gada. 
It will be called Sakata when all the planets occupy the 1st and the 7th houses. When all the planets occupy the 4th and the 10th is called Vihaga. If all the planets occupy the 1st, 5th and 9th houses it is called Sringataka. If all the planets are in5th and 9th it is called Hala. So say the learned in astrology. 
Stanza 5: 
When benefics are in first and seventh and malefics are in fourth and tenth it is called Vajra. If the planets are reversed then it is called Yava. If the planets are mixed it is called Kamala. If the planets are outside kendras it is called Vapi. 
Stanza 6: 
I have give these Vajra yogas, etc., in accordance with older sciences, but how can Budha and Sukra be in the 4th from the Sun? 
Stanza 7: 
If all the planets are within the first four houses of the 1st, 2nd 3rd and 4th kendras Yupa, Ishu, Sakthi and Danda yogas are respectively formed. 
Stanza 8: 
If all the planets are in the first 7 houses from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th kendras they give rise to Nau, Kuta, Chatra and Chapa yogas respectively. If these yogas are in other houses they are called Ardachandra. 
Stanza 9: 
If all the planets are in the alternate houses from the 2nd from lagna, it goes under the name of Samudra. If from lagna planets are similarly situated, it forms Chakra. This is the summary of Akriti yogas. 
Stanza 10: 
By all the planets occupying 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 houses, they form seven yogas, viz., Vallaki, Dama, Pasa, Kedara, Shula, Yuga and Gola, respectively. These are to be considered in the absence of the previously mentioned yogas. 
Stanza 11: 
Rajju produces envy, foreign residence and fondness for traveling. Musala makes one proud, wealthy, and capable of doing many works. Nala makes a person limbless, determined, rich and courageous. Srik makes him happy and Sarpa gives him great misery. 
Stanza 12: 
Asraya yogas, when they join other yogas become fruitless. The yogas with which Asrayas join will give results. When Asrayas are free, they give their own results. 
Stanza 13: 
Gada=fond of sacrifices, rich; Sakata=lives by carriages, sickly, bad wife; Vihaga=ambassador, traveler, quarrelsome; Sringataka=happiness after a long age; Hala=agriculturist. 
Stanza 14: 
Vajra=enjoys happiness in the beginning and end of his life, popular, courageous; Yava=warlike, happy in the end; Padma=wellknown reputation, great happiness, and good character; Vapi=good health, accumulator of money and miser 
Stanza 15: 
Yupa=liberal, watchful, performs sacrifices; Sara=fond of killing, jailor, maker of weapons; Sakti=mean, lazy, devoid of wealth and happiness; Danda=servitude, rejected by or separated from those who are dear. 
Stanza 16: 
Nou=famous, unsteady fortune and miserly; Kuta=liar, imprisonment; Chatra=helping relations, enjoyment in old age; Chapa=courageous enjoying life in the first and last parts of his days. 
Stanza 17: 
Ardhachandra=popular, handsome, leader; Samudra=equal to a ruler, happy; Chakra=respected by sovereigns; Veena=intelligent and skilful, clever in dancing and music. 
Stanza 18: 
Damini=liberal, philanthropic, protector, many cattle; Pasa=possessing relations and servants who are clever in acquiring wealth, and bad in behaviour; Kedara=agriculturist, helping many; Shula=courageous, having wounds, fond of wealth but poor. 
Stanza 19: 
Yuga=poor, unbeliever; Gola=penniless, sinful, ignorant, skilful in mean arts, lazy, traveling. These are Nabhasa yogas related by me, and they will always be productive of their own results. 
Chapter 13 Chandrayogadhyaya 
Stanza 1: 
When Moon occupies quadrants, etc. from Sun, three yogas arise called Adhama, Sama, Varishta respectively, producing politeness, wealth, wisdom, intelligence and skill accordingly. If Moon is in his own or friendly Navamsa during the day and night possessing the aspect of Jupiter and Venus respectively, the person will be wealthy and happy 
Stanza 2: 
When benefics occupy the 6th, 7th and 8th from Moon, they cause Adhi yoga and the result is the birth of a commander, a minister or king. Persons born in this conjunction (adhi yoga) will be gentlemanly, happy, surrounded with luxury, without foes, long-lived and rejected by diseases 
Stanza 3: 
With the exception of Sun, other planets in the 2nd from Moon in the 12th from him and in the 2nd and 12th from Moon cause Sunapha, Anapha and Dhuradhura yogas respectively. If these aren’t so, many say it’s kemadruma. If planets are in quadrants from lagna or Moon or if Moon is combined with planets, there’s no kemadruma. Some say these yogas arise from quadrants and navamsas, but their doctrine hasn’t been accepted Stanza 4: 
There are 30 varieties of Sunapha and Anapha conjunction. There are 180 varieties of Duradhara. The intended varieties can be found out by placing planets in regular order and dropping the first in proceeding to the last and repeating this 
Stanza 5: 
A person born in Sunapha will be king or his equal with self-acquired wealth, intelligent, wealthy and reputed. A person born under Anapha will be a ruler, healthy, moral, renowned, enjoying good pleasures, fond of decorations and free from mental sorrow 
Stanza 6: 
One born under duradhura enjoys all pleasures, has wealth and conveyances, will be liberal and possessed of good servants. The person born under kemadruma, although he may take his birth in a royal family, will be dirty, sorrowful, doing work against his caste, poor, dependent and roguish 
Stanza 7: 
If Mars causes these yogas, the person will be energetic, wealthy, warlike and adventurous. If Mercury causes the yogas, the person will be skilful, have sweet speech and be learned in arts. If Jupiter causes the yogas, the person will be rich, charitable, happy and respected by rulers. If Venus, he’ll be fond of women, very wealthy and will enjoy sensual pleasures 
Stanza 8: 
If Saturn causes these yogas, the man will enjoy others’ wealth and articles, will be engaged in various works and be a leader of an assembly. Moon, if visible in the day, does mischief but when he’s invisible, he’ll be auspicious. Otherwise, the results will be different 
Stanza 9: 
When all benefics are in Upachayas from lagna, the person will be extremely wealthy. When all benefics are in Upachayas from Moon, he’ll be wealthy. When two benefics are in Upachayas, there’ll be moderate wealth. Less than that will produce little wealth. The results from these will predominate over others

Chapter 15 Pravarajya yoga 
Stanza 1: 
When there are four or more powerful planets in one house, the persons born will become Sakya, Aajivika, Bikshu, Vriddha, Chakra, Nirgrantha and Vanyasana, when Mahaya, Gnya, Guru, Kshapakara, Sita, Prabhakari and Ina are powerful respectively. The pravrajya yogas are determined by the most powerful planets. When these planets have suffered a defeat, the person will renounce pravrajya afterwards 
Stanza 2: 
If powerful pravrajya-causing planets are in combust with Sun, then the persons born won’t take up sanyasa but will greatly worship those who have embraced sanyasa. If the yogakaraka and defeated planets are aspected by other planets, the person would be making an application for diksha Stanza 3: 
When janmesha isn’t aspected by other planets but aspects Saturn, or when Saturn aspects a weak janmesha or if Moon is in Saturn’s Drekkana and occupies the amsa of Saturn or Mars and has saturnine aspect, the person will have diksha Stanza 4: 
If Jupiter, Moon and lagna are aspected by Saturn, and if Jupiter is in the 9th, the persons born would be a king who’d write on shastras or sciences. If 9th is occupied by Saturn unaspected by any planet, the person will become a dikshita when he’s born in rajayoga
